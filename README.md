# Barrios_Populares_CABA_ARG
Analysis focused on understanding the characteristics and distribution of "Barrios Populares" (possible translation: poor and working class neighborhoods) in Ciudad Aut√≥noma de Buenos Aires, Argentina.


# Theorical frame

¬øWhat does mean "barrio popular"?  Those neighborhoods called villas, settlements and informal urbanizations that present different degrees of precariousness. They must be a minimum of eight grouped or contiguous families where more than half of their inhabitants do not have title to the land or formal access to two basic services (electricity, water, sewage).

üïµÔ∏è Some questions to resolve:

‚ûñ What is the department with the greatest number of popular neighborhoods registered in the registry?

‚ûñWhat are the neighborhoods with the highest population density in each province?

‚ûñHow many families live there?

‚ûñWhat is the relationship with the ownership of the property?

‚ûñWhat are the conditions of access to public services?

‚ûñPopulation density by neighborhood.

‚ûñWhat are the ten oldest neighborhoods?
